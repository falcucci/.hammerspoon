# My Hammerspoon Configs

This repository contains my personal configuration files for the [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) automation tool for macOS. Hammerspoon allows me to write Lua scripts to automate tasks and customize my macOS experience.

## Installation

To use these configs, you'll need to have Hammerspoon installed on your Mac. You can download the latest version from the [Hammerspoon website](https://www.hammerspoon.org/).

Once you have Hammerspoon installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/{{username}}/hammerspoon-config.git ~/.hammerspoon
```

This will create a `.hammerspoon` directory in your home folder and copy the configuration files from this repository into it.

## Usage

To use my Hammerspoon configs, simply launch Hammerspoon from your Applications folder. Hammerspoon will automatically load the `init.lua` file in your `.hammerspoon` directory, which contains all of the Lua scripts and configuration settings.

My configs include several useful hotkeys and window management functions, as well as customizations for the Dock and menu bar. Feel free to modify and customize these configs to suit your own needs.

## Credits

Many of the Lua scripts in this repository were adapted from or inspired by the excellent [Hammerspoon Spoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/) library and the [awesome-hammerspoon](https://github.com/ashfinal/awesome-hammerspoon) repository. Thanks to the Hammerspoon community for all of their hard work and contributions!
